翻译目前还在进行中。大多数核心功能的翻译已经完成，但例如邮件，DNS，HTTPD配置等仍有很多词句未翻译。除此之外还有例如半角全角混用，英语单词与中文之间空格时有时无，使用多个不同词汇来指示同一概念，从英文到中文有多个完全不同意义时导致的翻译错误等一堆问题:P。一些技术性词汇（例如key，handler，之类的）咱因为一般见到都是没有翻译的于是这里也就没有翻译了。如果有意改进的话欢迎给咱扔个pull request w

### 使用了的翻译
感谢POEdit，翻译时很方便地导入了很多来自其他翻译者的翻译（包含机翻）。但因为这些翻译是匿名的，这里咱就不能一一列出这些翻译者的名字了。除了这些导入的翻译以外，其余均为咱个人的翻译。

# DirectAdmin Evolution Skin Simplified Chinese
This repo hosts the simplified Chinese (zh_Hans) language files for the new DirectAdmin Evolution skin.
Please refer to https://help.directadmin.com/item.php?id=704&in1=zh_Hans for installation instructions.

The translation is still WIP (about 91% translated). Many of the core features should have been translated, but areas such as mail, DNS, HTTPD configurations, etc. are still missing many of the translations. There are also other problems such as inconsistent use of half-width and full-width symbols, spacing, vocabularies, along with some ambiguous translations due to the use of polysemous words in the source language, and more :P. Some technical terms are remained as is (such as key, handler, etc.) because that's what I have been seeing most of the time. Feel free to send me a pull request if you want to improve this language file.

### Credit
Thanks to POEdit, I was able to import many of the translations from other contributors (contains machine translations). However, since the contributions are anonymous, I am not able to name them. I have translated the rest of the fields where no translation was available or the quality was not up to standard.
